    <h1>   Project 1: Snake Game</h1>
    <br>
<img src="SnakeGame.jfif" height="400">
    <h1>Our game was a remake of the popular snake game, but with a couple modifications. My partner and I made the snake out of a bunch of small turtles, and whenever the snake ate the "apple", which just looked like a red dot, it would gain one more turtle and get longer. In our code, my partner and I introduced while loops and if statements to move the snake around and to make the snake become longer whenever it ate an apple. Also, we used certain turtle methods in order to end the game if the snake collided with the border or collided with its own body.</h1>

    <h1>   Project 2: Spaceship Battle Game</h1>
    <br>

    <h1>Our game was called Spaceship Battle. For this game, we used common Google images for the player (which is the spaceship) and the alien. First off, the game asks for a "username" from the player. The object of the game was to shoot the aliens before they reach you. If they reached you, the game was over and you lost. Also, the bullet that the spaceship fired was in the shape of a turtle. In our project, we introduced if statements, while loops, functions for parts of the game, lists, amd we also included event listeners so that the player could move the spaceship with the arrow keys and fire a bullet with the spacebar. We also displayed a "game over" screen if the player lost.</h1>

    <h1>   Project 3: Tower Defense Game</h1>
    <br>
<img src="Capture.jfif" height="400">
    <h1>This game was made on Scratch. For this game, we used a background image and our sprites off of Scratch for the minions and tower. First, there is a menu screen where you can press the start button. Then, the game appears. You can see your score and money, and you are able to drag the tower anywhere on the screen. The object of the game is to prevent the minions from making it to the end of the path by throwing basketballs at them (which is what the towers do). If the minions make it to the end of the path, you lose, and a losing screen appears with a button that says "play again". If you press this button, you are prompted back to the game screen. Out of the 10 requirements, the seven that we fulfilled were events, scores (you get a point when you hit a minion), input, change of costumes (making the minions look like they are walking), multiple backgrounds (start, game, and end screens), animation (moving the minions along the path), and sound (when the minions are hit, there is a basketball sound).</h1>

    <h1>   Project 4: Rover Phone Home</h1>

    <h1>My partner and I decided that the rover was likely in the Inland Forests habitat. Firstly, we assigned graphs to each of the four sensors, as shown above. Then, we looked at the attributes of each habitat. In the Inland Forests, it is stated that there are “smooth constant temperatures that vary slightly throughout the day.” This is what we see from the temperature graph, a pretty constant temperature with some variations. It also says that Inland Forests have “low ambient light during the daytime.” On the light graph, we see a constant line (until the end of the graph), at a relatively low value on the axes. This would correspond to the low ambient light. In Inland Forests, there is also said to be “constant howl of the wind, occasional thunderstorms.” This would mean that the sound graph should have a relatively high value, with there being some discrepancies for the storms, but for the most part the values should be low. Finally, there is said to be “little to no wind.” This means that the movement graph should be at a relatively high and constant value, with some discrepancies, which is what we see. Based on all of the connections to the graphs, we can conclude that the Inland Forests is the correct habitat the rover is in.</h1>
    <h1>   Project 5: Making Meaning from Data (3.2.4)</h1>
<img src="BarGraph.jfif" height="400">
    <h1>My partner and I had to make many graphs for this project. By taking data from a file called "honey.csv," we used for loops, if statements, and functions like the append function to plot the data. We plotted total honey production for all the states, plotted the average honey production for all the states, and grouped the states into three categories: Large Honey Producers, Medium Honey Producers, and Small Honey Producers. We graphed these groups of states as well. This project taught us how to grab data from a file and use different functions to graph it on a plot, which allowed us to visualize the data and make connection.</h1>
