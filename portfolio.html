    <h1>Our game was a remake of the popular snake game, but with a couple modifications. My partner and I made the snake out of a bunch of small turtles, and whenever the snake ate the "apple", which just looked like a red dot, it would gain one more turtle and get longer. In our code, my partner and I introduced while loops and if statements to move the snake around and to make the snake become longer whenever it ate an apple. Also, we used certain turtle methods in order to end the game if the snake collided with the border or collided with its own body.</h1>

    <h1>   Project 2: Spaceship Battle Game</h1>
    <br>

    <h1>Our game was called Spaceship Battle. For this game, we used common Google images for the player (which is the spaceship) and the alien. First off, the game asks for a "username" from the player. The object of the game was to shoot the aliens before they reach you. If they reached you, the game was over and you lost. Also, the bullet that the spaceship fired was in the shape of a turtle. In our project, we introduced if statements, while loops, functions for parts of the game, lists, amd we also included event listeners so that the player could move the spaceship with the arrow keys and fire a bullet with the spacebar. We also displayed a "game over" screen if the player lost.</h1>
